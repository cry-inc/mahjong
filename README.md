This is a simple Mahjong solitaire game. It is written in C# and
uses the logos of various open source projects as tile images.

The game was a quick PoC for another implementation written in Scala.

There are no advanced features like a scoreboard or different tile setups,
but there are two other notable things included:
* Play on a web interface using the embedded web server.
  It uses the same graphics as the WinForms user interface.
  You can reach the web interface at http://127.0.0.1:8080/
* Setup Editor for creating your own Tile-Setups
  Start the executable with the argument -editor to activate it.
  You have to replace the file "setup.txt" to play with your custom setup.

Feel free to create PRs to add new tiles or update existing ones :)
1. Create transparent PNG with correct dimensions
2. Add filename without extension to tiles.txt
